James Thomson-Bache is a Dunedin based artist, working predominantly with canvas and wall mounted works, utilizing mediums of ink and acrylic paint to create abstract and expressionist pieces. Interested primarily in imagery which uses fine detail and balancing composition and contrast, with foundations in automatist techniques, the works attempt to create suggestions of movement, depth, rhythm and energy. 

The most technical works generally rely on the use of Indian ink on primed canvas, sometimes un-stretched. These works display the full effect of suggestive imagery, and produce an vision of unrealized forms, which grow and shrink, weave together and dissolve in motion with the viewers eyes and position. There is a strong element of expression in these, and the utilization of discovered technique to produce original and expressive works.

James holds a Bachelors of Art, double majoring in Art History and Visual Culture from the University of Otago.
